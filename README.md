```bash
$ cd sproutch && npm i

## Start the development environment
```bash

```
This will start an Expo development server, follow the instructions on your terminal to launch the desired platform client (web, iOS, Android, etc.).
Once the client of your choice is launched, you will see a Storybook app and you can start to code.

In parallel, the `dev` command launches a Typescript developement environnement which auto build the Sproutch library so each change you make are instantly reflected on the Storybook app.
